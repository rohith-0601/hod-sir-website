        "briefBio": "Digvijay Sampatrao Pawar is an HOD in Transportation Systems Engineering in the Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Hyderabad. Prior to joining IITH in 2016, Digvijay was a senior research associate in IIT Bombay from 2015. He received his Masters and Doctoral Degree in Transportation Systems Engineering from IIT Bombay, India in 2015. He completed his Bachelors in Civil Engineering from Walchand College of Engineering, Sangli, India in 2009. His research predominantly focuses on traffic operations and safety, human factors and highway geometric design with emphasis on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Naturalistic Driving Studies (NDS). His contributions in developing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) for improving driver and pedestrian safety at uncontrolled intersections are noteworthy. He has played a key role in designing and implementing several ITS technologies and establishing testbed at IITH for studies on autonomous vehicle systems (TiHAN). He received the Research Excellence Award from IIT Hyderabad for his significant research contributions in the field. He was awarded for Excellence in Thesis Work for outstanding research contributions from IIT Bombay (2014\u20132016) and Best Ph.D. Thesis on Urban Mobility in Cities of Developing Countries from CODATU-2017, France. He was selected as a young conference chair for the World Conference on Transport Research 2019 (WCTR-Y). His research articles have appeared in leading international journals.",
